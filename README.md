# Barcode
This code opens the webcam, you can show a barcode (ens) to it (needs to be of good quality)
Once it reads a barcode, it will display the barcode numbers on the screen.
Press q to close the webcam.

For each barcode it finds, it will try and open the link found through an ens lookup website. If its in their DB, you will find your wanted product.
Doesn't seem to work that well on food objects, but it does work on objects like games, some school books, make up products (home tested).

Future developments may include:

Instead of opening the site to the buyable product (to buy on amazon for example), maybe just popup the names of the product. Imo it's the same thing.
